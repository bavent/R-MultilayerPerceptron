# R-MultilayerPerceptron
R code of multilayer perceptron feedforward neural network.

This was designed as a teaching tool for VT's CMDA 4654: Intermediate Data Analytics and Machine Learning course to teach the students the structure/components of a [somewhat-customizable] MLP. With that in mind, the code is written to show the structure and function of the neural network, *not* performance. Use a real ML library for that.
