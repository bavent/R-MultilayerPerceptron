# R-MultilayerPerceptron
R code of multilayer perceptron feedforward neural network.

This was designed as a teaching tool for VT's CMDA 4654: *Intermediate Data Analytics and Machine Learning* course to teach the students the structure/components of a [somewhat-customizable] MLP. With that in mind, the code is written to show the structure and function of the neural network, *not* performance or reliability. Use a real ML library for that. In either case...

###Usage
The ffneuralnet.R file contains the core neural network functions. The example files automatically source these functions in (see comments in the survival_example.R to locate its respective dataset first). There is a plotting function to plot the decision boundary for 2-dimensional data (credit to Jun Ma: http://junma5.weebly.com/data-blog). If you want to create your own neural network and need more help...then good luck and have fun!
