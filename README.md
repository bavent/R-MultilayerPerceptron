# R-MultilayerPerceptron
R code of multilayer perceptron feedforward neural network.

This was designed as a teaching tool for VT's CMDA 4654: Intermediate Data Analytics and Machine Learning course to teach the students the structure/components of a [somewhat-customizable] MLP. With that in mind, the code is written to show the structure and function of the neural network, *not* performance. Use a real ML library for that. In either case...

Usage: Run the ffneuralnet.R file to load the core neural network functions, then run any of the example files (see comments in the survival_example.R to locate its respective dataset first). If you want to create your own neural network and need more help, then I am surprised -- but also contact me and I can probably help out.
